How can I install these files as different names than they are shipped as.\n\nAlternatively, I could just leave them out of the package altogether, and let users figure out how to write their own mirror .properties files, rather than providing starting examples.",

I think this could work however:\n\n$(INSTALL) -o root -g root -T consumer.properties $(DESTDIR)/$(SYSCONFDIR)/mirror/consumer.properties.example\n\nand the same for producer.properties.\n\nIt is ugly though. I will try some Makefile target expansion and let you know",
